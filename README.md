# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
### This project analyzes data from a variety Kickstarter Campaigns in order to reveal the characteristics of successful campaigns. Specifically, the analysis focuses on the characteristics of campaigns in the Theater category and the Play subcategory and seeks to determine the optimal financial goal and launch date to ensure that Louise develops a successful campaign to fund her new play.

## Analysis and Challenges

This analysis sought to uncover the outcomes of a set of Kickstarter campaigns based on the financial goal set by each campaign and the date that each campaign was launched. While the financial data provided was ready to manipulate, the information for the launch date of each campaign was originally provided as a Unix timestamp and needed to be converted to a readable human date. Additionally, information on the Category and Subcategory of each campaign was provided in a single column, making it challenging to filter each variable separately. Two separate columns were made for Category and Subcategory to alleviate this issue.
